4. System design  
First, I need to see what my View should look like. So I consulted a few sample templates online and based on that developed the design for my website. It is also responsible for sending the request to the servlet to process.

Next, develop the functions to serve the Controller that is the Model. It responds to requests from the view and it also responds to directives from the controller to update itself. I use objects declared in the DTO folder. Then use the DAO to interact and get data from the database. My objects include account, category, product, and size.

Finally, is the Controller part. It helps to regulate all operations from incoming command to outgoing command, From view to model, and vice versa.

5. Conclusion and Discussion
- Through this assignment, I'm in particular and my group in general have learned many new and useful things.  
- Firstly, the assignment has many advantages, but besides it also has many disadvantages:  
       + Advantages:  
          . Many unique functions.  
          . Intuitive interface, easy to use and get used to.  
          . Practically applicable to online sales.  
       + Disadvantages:  
          . There are still some unfinished functions such as: add to card...  
          . The src code has not been minified, is lengthy, and has not packed many files.  
  - After completing the assignment, I better understand the MVC2 model. Manipulate more fluently on the database. Practice thinking to handle problems better, and more patiently.  
- I think the first thing to improve is completing the Add To Cart function. Then develop more cool functions. Learn and master the MVC2 pattern. And can put the website into business, and trade.
